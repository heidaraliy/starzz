            a hand-made NFT project revolving around our favorite artists and musicians.

        in perpetuity, musicians and artists fade in and out of spotlights, ebbing and flowing with culture and society. 
        as some recede into obscurity, others carve their own niche and create their own claimed space. starzz aims to document 
        this ebb and flow through trading cards, initially documenting rappers and rnb artists, before moving on to different genres.

        <h1 className='mt-12 mx-12 text-l text-center'>
        just as baseball and basketball players boast their own achievements and accolades, musicians too, have their own awards
        to show off. furthermore, each musician has a set of skills that are specific to them. one may be a better singer than a rapper,
        another may have more presence and energy when playing a show. these attributes will be documented and displayed on each
        card, signifying their ability in each field.

        <h1 className='mt-12 mx-12 text-xl font-bold italic text-center'>
        with an initial release of 150 cards and a staggered release of 50 *new* cards every quarter, the supply is limited and curtailed.
        each edition will bring with it it's own theme, musical genres, and beautiful art.
